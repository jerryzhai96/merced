Preliminary Folder Structure
============================

> This is a rough start, make changes as needed.

### Directory layout

    .
    ├── build                   # Compiled files (alternatively `dist`)
    ├── docs                    # Documentation files (alternatively `doc`)
    ├── src                     # Source files 
    ├── tools                   # Tools and utilities
    ├── user                    # Upload miscelaneous working files here
    └── README.md

> Use short lowercase names at least for the top-level files and folders.

### Source files

The actual source files of a software project are usually stored inside the
`src` folder. Alternatively, you can put them into the `lib` (if you're
developing a library), or into the `app` folder (if your application's source
files are not supposed to be compiled).

### Document files

    .
